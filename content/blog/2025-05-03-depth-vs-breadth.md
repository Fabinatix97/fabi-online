### Introduction

- Hook the reader with a relatable observation: as developers, we’re often encouraged to know everything.
- Briefly introduce your own experience as a full-stack developer who once prioritized breadth over depth.
- State the thesis: choosing to specialize—starting with VSCode—has changed the way you work and grow as a developer.

### The Temptation of Breadth

- Describe the pressure in tech to keep up with every new tool, framework, or best practice.
- Share your own experience: being familiar with many tools and languages, but feeling mediocre in all of them.
- Introduce the turning point: realizing that breadth without depth left you without mastery.

### The VSCode vs. IntelliJ Moment

- Tell the story: colleagues recommending IntelliJ, calling it a "real IDE."
- Share why you stuck with VSCode—your influences, your curiosity, and your resistance to switching for the sake of it.
- Explain that VSCode initially seems simple, but reveals more the longer you use it.

### The Power of Specialization

- Dive into what you’ve gained by going deep with VSCode:
  - Workflow speed
  - Customization with extensions
  - Productivity gains
  - Confidence in your environment
- Mention how this depth made you a better developer—not because of the tool itself, but because you committed to mastering it.

### The Broader Lesson

- Generalize the insight: this isn’t just about VSCode. It’s about the value of choosing something and learning it deeply.
- Talk about how focus reduces cognitive load, boosts creativity, and ultimately makes you more effective.
- Encourage readers to consider where they’re spreading themselves too thin—and where they might go deeper instead.

### Conclusion

- Reaffirm your main message: mastery matters, and it starts with choosing to go deep, not wide.
- Invite the reader to reflect on their own tools and habits.
- Optional: a closing quote or insight, e.g. “Tools don’t make great developers. Mastery does.”
